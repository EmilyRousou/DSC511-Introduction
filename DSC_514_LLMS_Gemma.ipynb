The relatively crude disc cutting techniques of the time and the thickness of the needles used on record players limited the number of grooves per inch that could be inscribed on the disc surface , and a high rotation speed was necessary to achieve acceptable recording and playback fidelity . 78 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor in 1925 , which ran at 3600 rpm with a 46:1 gear ratio , resulting in a rotation speed of 78.26 rpm . These factors , combined with the 10 - inch songwriters and performers increasingly tailored their output to fit the new medium . The 3 - minute single remained the standard into the 1960s when the availability of microgroove recording and improved mastering techniques enabled recording artists to increase the duration of their recordings . # With the introduction of superior record - cutting techniques , the more music could be stored on smaller discs . This meant that radio DJs could fit more music in the same amount of space . A 7 \\\" 45rpm record can hold [ 4:30 ] ( URL_1 ) and the limit was extended . 45s were commonly used in the 50s and 60s as Rock \\\\' n \\\\' Roll was gaining popularity which will have influenced future musicians and become part of the genre . Since digital media has become available , the limit on the length of songs is largely irrelevant , however radio has adapted around the song length of ~4 minutes as well as the \\\\' standard length \\\\' becoming somewhat of a tradition since that was how long the songs were of those influencing them . * * ELI5 :* * The situation is akin to an old story of a little girl watching her mother cook a joint of beef . Before cooking , the mother cut of a large slice from one end . The girl then asks her Mother \\\" Why do you cut one end off the beef ? \\\" To which the Mother replies \\\" Well , that \\\\'s how my mother cooked a joint of beef . \\\" The little girl then visits her Grandmother and asks \\\" Why do you cut one end off the beef ? \\\" The Grandmother replies \\\" Well , that \\\\'s how * my * mother cooked a joint of beef . \\\" Finally , the little girl visits her Great - Grandmother . \\\" Why do you cut one end off the beef ? \\\" she asks . The Great - Grandmother replies , \\\" The pan was too small . \\\"', \\\"Non ELI version : It comes from the tempo of the song and typical song structure . Normally songs have a BPM ( beats per minute ) of around 70 - 180 , but something like 120 is a fairly typical average and also makes the math associated with this very easy to figure out . Also , most songs are in 4/4 ( four beats per measure ) so keep that in mind . Almost all music has repeating sections , these can be broken down to various levels . A drum pattern may last just one or two bars ( measures ) , but melodies typically last four or eight measures and these are often doubled up to support lyrics . So consider this typical song structure : intro , verse , chorus , verse , chorus , bridge , chorus , chorus Lets break it down by section and their typical lengths : * intro : 4 bars * verse : 8 bars * chorus : 16 bars * verse : 8 bars * chorus : 16 bars * bridge : 8 bars * chorus : 16 bars * chorus : 16 bars * outro : 4 bars > Total : 96 bars > > 96 bars * 4 beats per bar = 384 beats > > 384 beats / 120 beats per minute = 3.2 minutes As you can see , this typical song structure will usually fall in the 3 - 3.5 minute range . Note : Different genres will often result in different lengths because of their associated BPMs and the style ( suggesting things like the amount of repetition that is appropriate ) . For example : most club music has a long intro section as well as a structure where the main idea of the song is repeated almost exactly twice but with small changes between the first and second version . The intro helps DJs bring the songs in and the repetition gives them more ways to mix songs together . This is why you 'll usually see club music track lengths at around 6 - 9 minutes .\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chatgpt_answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23304,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"It's important to note that not all Republicans reject science. However, it's true that some Republicans do reject certain scientific concepts or findings, such as evolution and climate change. \\\\nOne reason why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts is that they may have religious or ideological beliefs that conflict with the scientific evidence. For example, some people might believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, which conflicts with the scientific evidence that the Earth is billions of years old. Similarly, some people might believe that humans have a special place in the universe and are not subject to the same natural laws that apply to other living things, which conflicts with the scientific evidence for evolution. \\\\nAnother reason why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts is that they may be skeptical of the scientific method and the ways in which scientists arrive at their conclusions. Some people might believe that scientists are biased or that the scientific process is flawed in some way, and therefore they might be more likely to reject scientific findings that they disagree with. \\\\nIt's also worth noting that some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts because they are misinformed about them or because they have been exposed to misinformation about them. For example, some people might believe that climate change is not real because they have heard false or misleading information about it. \\\\nIn short, there are many different reasons why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts. It's important to remember that science is a process of constantly learning and seeking new understanding, and that it's important to approach scientific questions with an open and curious mind.\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are plants, animals, or microorganisms that have had their DNA modified using genetic engineering techniques. These techniques allow scientists to take a gene from one organism and insert it into the DNA of another organism, giving the new organism a new characteristic that it did not have before. One reason why some people are concerned about GMOs is that they may pose a threat to the environment. For example, if a genetically modified plant is released into the wild, it could potentially cross-breed with native plants, leading to the spread of the modified genes. This could have unintended consequences, such as creating weeds that are resistant to herbicides or damaging the local ecosystem. Another concern is that the use of GMOs may lead to the loss of biodiversity. If genetically modified crops become dominant, it could reduce the number of different types of crops being grown and lead to a loss of diversity in the plant world. It's also worth noting that there is ongoing debate about the safety of GMOs for human consumption. Some people believe that GMOs may have negative effects on human health, while others believe that they are safe to eat. The scientific community has not reached a consensus on this issue, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of GMOs.\\\"]\",\n          \"['Latin America is a region, not a place or a continent. It refers to the parts of the Americas where Spanish, Portuguese, and French are the main languages spoken. Latin America includes countries in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The main jist of the history of Latin America is that it was colonized by Spain and Portugal in the 16th and 17th centuries. This means that these countries sent explorers and settlers to the region, and they set up governments and economies there. The indigenous people who lived in the region before the Europeans arrived were often treated unfairly and mistreated. After many years, some of the countries in Latin America gained independence from their European colonizers and became their own nations. However, they often faced challenges such as poverty, conflict, and dictatorships. In recent years, many countries in Latin America have made progress in improving their economies and political systems, and working towards greater equality and justice for their people.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"open_qa\",\n          \"medicine\",\n          \"wiki_csai\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 22534,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Why do dishonour fees exist?\",\n          \"Do people in China know their internet is censored ?

We do n\\\\'t have one in our cars for a few reasons , first , nuclear reactors do n\\\\'t scale down past a certain point - you ca n\\\\'t make one arbitrarily small , because you need \\\" critical mass \\\" of uranium . Second , they require lots of very heavy shielding , and third , the capacity for accidents and malfeasance with millions of nuclear reactors in automobiles , is way too high .', \\\"ok , everyone else does n't understand a lot of stuff , especially how to explain things to a five year old . So here we go : ok so you start off with a small pellet of uranium 235 and you shoot a very small particle at it called a neutron . When the neutron hits the pellet the atoms of uranium 235 begin breaking apart into 3 things krypton 92 , barium 141 , and 3 more neutrons . those three neutrons proceed to go crash into another atom and then the whole process is repeated . When this happens massive amounts of heat is produced and this is absorbed by water surrounding the reactor turning it into steam . The pressure from this steam turns a turbine which makes electricity in the case of a power plant . In an aircraft carier the steam directly turns the propellers . The reason an aircraft carier can go for years without refuling is because these pellets are very small and each one lasts for quite a while , and they have tons of room to store them on it . You ca n't make a smaller one to put in your car because of many different reasons : 1 ) you need a very large cooling system to be able to keep it running . 2 ) you would need to be monitoring the reactor and the road at the same time which would increase accidents 3 ) you need to be highly trained and very smart to be able to monitor these reactors 4 ) if you ever got in a car crash the reactor would melt down leaking radiation everywhere which would be VERY BAD ! 5 ) Uranium is highly radioactive and very dangerous , it requires extensive protective gear to be able to handle very very few people actually have this stuff . 6 ) uranium is very expensive not to mention the cost of installing a nuclear reactor in your car . And that 's why it wo n't work in a car . source : I 'm studying to be a nuclear engineer and I have looked into joining the navy 's nuclear program\\\", \\\"All reactors use the heat from nuclear fission to heat a fluid ( usually water ) in order to turn a turbine to generate electricity . As the fuel decays , the particles and energy it releases heat the water up , producing superheated steam . The steam is then directed through a turbine ; the turbine spins and turns a generator which generates electricity . The water also serves as a coolant , which is very important as if the reactor is not kept cool , it can become dangerously hot ; damaging the reactor vessel which is obviously not ideal since exposure to radioactive materials usually are n't is n't very good . Nuclear reactors are usually refueled between a few months and a couple of years , depending on their size and power output . We ca n't use nuclear reactors in our cars for a number of reasons : there are issues with building a safe reactor vessel at that size and there would be cooling issues at that scale ; the system would probably not generate enough electricity to power the car , while a reactor small enough to fit in a car might be capable of putting out enough energy to power it , a turbine and generator at that size would not be able to turn all of that energy to electricity ; finally , it is obviously not good to be continuously exposed to radioactive sources every day and traffic collisions would be much worse , as radioactive material could be spread out in the area around the accident .\\\"]\",\n          \"['\\\\\\\\nHEX color codes are a way to represent colors on a computer or other digital device. They are used to specify the colors of images, text, and other elements on a computer screen or other display.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHEX color codes consist of a series of six characters, usually letters or numbers, that represent the different colors that make up a particular color. The first two characters represent the amount of red in the color, the next two characters represent the amount of green, and the final two characters represent the amount of blue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, the HEX color code #FF0000 represents the color red, because it has a high amount of red (FF) and no green or blue (00). The HEX color code #00FF00 represents the color green, because it has a high amount of green (FF) and no red or blue (00). The HEX color code #0000FF represents the color blue, because it has a high amount of blue (FF) and no red or green (00).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen these codes are used to display colors on a computer screen or other digital device, the device uses the codes to mix different amounts of red, green, and blue light to create the desired color. This process is known as RGB color mixing, and it allows computers and other digital devices to display a wide range of colors using just three primary colors: red, green, and blue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, HEX color codes are a way to represent colors on a computer or other digital device by specifying the amounts of red, green, and blue that make up a particular color.

Over the years , these types of work have been interpreted by different rabbis as technology and lifestyle changed . The end result is that * * you 're not allowed to drive , use the phone , turn on the lights , cook food , or even tear off a piece of toilet paper to wipe your ass**](http://www . URL_0 /article_20923_5 - bizarre - realities - life - at - edge - gaza.html ) - from the humoristic URL_0 Think about it : if you control sex , you control the birth rates of the population , the possible economic and political gains obtained from pre - arranged marriages and even the people 's general happiness . This already presents a superficial analysis of societal regulation of behavior and the forces and causes behind them . [ This website in particular ] ( URL_3 ) is very useful with its compilations of theories and the many different observations and summaries it offers , if anyone 's interested in learning more . One of the possible explanations for the logic behind making certain activities taboo or , at least , restricting them , comes from the understandings of social structure by people like [ Radcliffe - Brown ] ( URL_2 ) . For him , in a simplified view , practices and beliefs in societies always serve certain functions , contributing in a certain way to the success of society . Say you are in a certain technological step and do n't understand the intricacies of pregnancy . Your wife keeps having miscarriages and no one knows why , except for the local religious figure , who has an explanation related to your religion and/or lifestyle ( maybe you did n't sacrifice enough animals ? did n't pray after having sex ? did something the rest of the population is n't used to and , therefore , finds strange ? ) . The point is , people start believing in the religious figure 's instructions , maybe because they know somebody who knows somebody who was healed when they followed all instructions or maybe because everybody 's been following their instructions for centuries already , so why should they stop ? * * TL;DR * * Sex is a very intimate and almost mandatory activity for humans , making it so that it can be done in a multitude of ways and some people might never learn about them , thus allowing for some aspects of it to be found strange or even straight up repulsive ( think homosexuality for people that spent their entire lives thinking about heterosexuality not only as the norm , but as the only logical choice ) . Combine that with the rise of social and religious constructions that mix legitimate spiritual concepts with desire for power and you 've got a subject that is very easy to control and can be very lucrative/ influential . Thus , the answer : no , puritanism does n't usually rise from objectives that favor the continuation of the species , it 's a social construction , although that could mean there 's a psychological * motion * behind it , but not strictly a benefit .\"]\n",

The number of steps up you counted minus one determines the \" first \" or \" second \" or \" third \" etc . part of the relation .

about an hour quicker to cross my country ( Australia ) in that direction , about 4.5 vs 5.5 hours . So , quite a difference . The direction of the winds is due to the rotation of the earth . EDIT : From [ URL_0 :] ( https://www . URL_0 /jetstream / jet ) \" Jet streams are relatively narrow bands of strong wind in the upper levels of the atmosphere . The winds blow from west to east in jet streams but the flow often shifts to the north and south . Jet streams follow the boundaries between hot and cold air . \" \" ... the earth \\'s rotation divided this circulation into three cells . The earth \\'s rotation is responsible for the jet stream as well . \"', \"The earth 's rotation does not affect how fast an airplane flies through the air or over the ground . However , the prevailing winds will affect an airplane 's ground speed .\", 'No , the atmosphere rotates along with the earth so airplanes are still in the same rotation .']\n",

I have never heard of a \" rapid \" formula , but it appears to be something that is being marketed in Australia and New Zealand . The difference is that it is suppose to be taken on an empty stomach ( which makes all medications absorb faster ) and it made to dissolve faster in the stomach . That makes it less shelf stable and have a shorter shelf - life . So that is a downside . Mostly they have an excuse to charge you more for something that does not actually cost more to produce , and 10 - 15 min for my pain pills to start working is just fine by me .', 'They both contain the same active ingredient : paracetamol . What the \" Rapid \" product also contains is caffeine , which helps increase the speed of absorption of the paracetamol .

 [\"There are several sources where you can find accurate historical distribution data for mutual funds. One option is to visit the website of the mutual fund company or the fund's sponsor. Many mutual fund companies make this information readily available on their websites, and it is typically presented in the form of a table or chart that shows the distribution amounts for different periods of time.Another option is to use financial data websites or databases that provide historical mutual fund data. Some examples include Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, and Bloomberg. These websites typically allow you to search for a specific mutual fund and view its distribution history. In some cases, you may need to create an account or subscribe to a service in order to access this information.Finally, you can also find mutual fund distribution data in annual or semi-annual reports that mutual fund companies are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports are available on the SEC's website (www.sec.gov) or through the EDGAR system, which is a database of publicly available company filings.\"]\n",

a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This enzyme plays a critical role in maintaining the health of red blood cells. People with G6PD deficiency are at risk for developing anemia, a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues.\\n\\nThere are a few things you can do to help manage G6PD deficiency in your 1 1/2 year old son:\\n\\nFollow a diet that is low in fava beans and other foods that contain high levels of an oxidant called oxidized nucleosides. These foods can be harmful to people with G6PD deficiency because they can cause the destruction of red blood cells. A list of foods to avoid can be found here: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/g6pd-deficiency#diet\\n\\nContinue breastfeeding your son. Breast milk is the perfect food for infants and provides all the nutrients they need for healthy growth and development.\\n\\nIt is not necessary to expose your son to sunlight every morning, as there is no evidence to suggest that sunlight has any specific benefit for people with G6PD deficiency. However, it is important to ensure that your son gets enough vitamin D, which is essential for bone health and can be obtained through diet and/or supplements.\\n\\nIt is also important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a management plan for your son's G6PD deficiency. This may include taking supplements, such as folic acid, and avoiding certain medications that could be harmful to people with G6PD deficiency. Your healthcare provider will be able to advise you on the best course of action for your son based on his specific needs and medical history.\"]\n",

Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads .

That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .\", \"HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal .

This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .\"]\n",

That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded .', 'The importance of the Wright Brothers and other early inventors was to prove it could be done . Once proven , the rest is just a process of incremental improvements that add up over time . Keep in mind that while there are lots of nifty stuff in modern aircraft , the biggest thing in my opinion that makes modern aircraft possible are the engines and the only major change from 100 years ago has been from piston to turbine .

However, a significant increase in blood pressure such as the one you described could be a cause for concern, especially if you have peripheral artery disease (PAD) and are taking lisinopril to manage your blood pressure. It's important to discuss this change in your blood pressure with your healthcare provider, as they may need to adjust your medication or recommend lifestyle changes to help manage your blood pressure.

In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety .

( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain .

Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively .

This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .\"]</td>\n",

Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .', 'In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical .', \"Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads .

              "2      [\"The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .\", \"HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .\", \"There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .\"]   \n",

That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded .', 'The importance of the Wright Brothers and other early inventors was to prove it could be done . Once proven , the rest is just a process of incremental improvements that add up over time . Keep in mind that while there are lots of nifty stuff in modern aircraft , the biggest thing in my opinion that makes modern aircraft possible are the engines and the only major change from 100 years ago has been from piston to turbine . Every other engine development is just making what we had the year before , a bit better , a bit lighter , a bit more powerful , a bit more reliable .']   \n",

However, a significant increase in blood pressure such as the one you described could be a cause for concern, especially if you have peripheral artery disease (PAD) and are taking lisinopril to manage your blood pressure. It's important to discuss this change in your blood pressure with your healthcare provider, as they may need to adjust your medication or recommend lifestyle changes to help manage your blood pressure. They may also want to monitor your blood pressure more closely to see if there are any patterns or underlying issues that need to be addressed.

It is typically soft, painless, and movable.\\n\\nCyst: A cyst is a sac-like structure that can contain fluid, pus, or other substances. Cysts can occur anywhere on the body and are usually painless.\\n\\nGanglion cyst: A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled sac that often appears on the wrist, hand, or foot. It can also occur in other areas of the body, including the arm. Ganglion cysts are usually painless and movable.\\n\\nBursitis: Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae (small fluid-filled sacs) that cushion and protect the joints.

This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .\"]</td>\n",

Cysts can occur anywhere on the body and are usually painless.\\n\\nGanglion cyst: A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled sac that often appears on the wrist, hand, or foot. It can also occur in other areas of the body, including the arm. Ganglion cysts are usually painless and movable.\\n\\nBursitis: Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae (small fluid-filled sacs) that cushion and protect the joints. Bursitis can cause a lump and discomfort in the shoulder area.\\n\\nIt is important to see a doctor if you have a lump in your arm that is persistent or bothersome.

We do n\\\\'t have one in our cars for a few reasons , first , nuclear reactors do n\\\\'t scale down past a certain point - you ca n\\\\'t make one arbitrarily small , because you need \\\" critical mass \\\" of uranium . Second , they require lots of very heavy shielding , and third , the capacity for accidents and malfeasance with millions of nuclear reactors in automobiles , is way too high .', \\\"ok , everyone else does n't understand a lot of stuff , especially how to explain things to a five year old . So here we go : ok so you start off with a small pellet of uranium 235 and you shoot a very small particle at it called a neutron . When the neutron hits the pellet the atoms of uranium 235 begin breaking apart into 3 things krypton 92 , barium 141 , and 3 more neutrons . those three neutrons proceed to go crash into another atom and then the whole process is repeated . When this happens massive amounts of heat is produced and this is absorbed by water surrounding the reactor turning it into steam . The pressure from this steam turns a turbine which makes electricity in the case of a power plant . In an aircraft carier the steam directly turns the propellers . The reason an aircraft carier can go for years without refuling is because these pellets are very small and each one lasts for quite a while , and they have tons of room to store them on it . You ca n't make a smaller one to put in your car because of many different reasons : 1 ) you need a very large cooling system to be able to keep it running . 2 ) you would need to be monitoring the reactor and the road at the same time which would increase accidents 3 ) you need to be highly trained and very smart to be able to monitor these reactors 4 ) if you ever got in a car crash the reactor would melt down leaking radiation everywhere which would be VERY BAD ! 5 ) Uranium is highly radioactive and very dangerous , it requires extensive protective gear to be able to handle very very few people actually have this stuff . 6 ) uranium is very expensive not to mention the cost of installing a nuclear reactor in your car . And that 's why it wo n't work in a car . source : I 'm studying to be a nuclear engineer and I have looked into joining the navy 's nuclear program\\\", \\\"All reactors use the heat from nuclear fission to heat a fluid ( usually water ) in order to turn a turbine to generate electricity . As the fuel decays , the particles and energy it releases heat the water up , producing superheated steam . The steam is then directed through a turbine ; the turbine spins and turns a generator which generates electricity . The water also serves as a coolant , which is very important as if the reactor is not kept cool , it can become dangerously hot ; damaging the reactor vessel which is obviously not ideal since exposure to radioactive materials usually are n't is n't very good . Nuclear reactors are usually refueled between a few months and a couple of years , depending on their size and power output . We ca n't use nuclear reactors in our cars for a number of reasons : there are issues with building a safe reactor vessel at that size and there would be cooling issues at that scale ; the system would probably not generate enough electricity to power the car , while a reactor small enough to fit in a car might be capable of putting out enough energy to power it , a turbine and generator at that size would not be able to turn all of that energy to electricity ; finally , it is obviously not good to be continuously exposed to radioactive sources every day and traffic collisions would be much worse , as radioactive material could be spread out in the area around the accident .\\\"]\",\n          \"['\\\\\\\\nHEX color codes are a way to represent colors on a computer or other digital device. They are used to specify the colors of images, text, and other elements on a computer screen or other display.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHEX color codes consist of a series of six characters, usually letters or numbers, that represent the different colors that make up a particular color. The first two characters represent the amount of red in the color, the next two characters represent the amount of green, and the final two characters represent the amount of blue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, the HEX color code #FF0000 represents the color red, because it has a high amount of red (FF) and no green or blue (00). The HEX color code #00FF00 represents the color green, because it has a high amount of green (FF) and no red or blue (00). The HEX color code #0000FF represents the color blue, because it has a high amount of blue (FF) and no red or green (00).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen these codes are used to display colors on a computer screen or other digital device, the device uses the codes to mix different amounts of red, green, and blue light to create the desired color. This process is known as RGB color mixing, and it allows computers and other digital devices to display a wide range of colors using just three primary colors: red, green, and blue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, HEX color codes are a way to represent colors on a computer or other digital device by specifying the amounts of red, green, and blue that make up a particular color. When these codes are used to display colors on a digital device, the device uses RGB color mixing to create the desired color using different amounts of red, green, and blue light.\\\\\\\\n']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_preprocessed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers_preprocessed_nopunctuations\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .', 'In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical .', \"Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads . And your government wants above all cheap and effective solutions that reduce winter accidents and keep people safe . They do n't care as much about the finish on your 1994 Honda Prelude .\"]   \n",

certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .\", \"HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .\", \"There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .\"]   \n",

Many of the the first known humans existed in the fertile crescent - modern day Iraq and surrounding areas , and it was just as sunny and hot as it is today . Melanin causes skin and eyes to have a darker color , and as a benefit reduced the amount of UV radiation absorbed into the skin . Eventually humans expanded into less hot and sunlit areas allowing for the survival and procreation of people who developed lighter colored eyes and skin because of the lack of need of melanin for survival .', 'They are not colored . Just as white paint is usually made from minerals found in clay . The crystals in white paint reflects all light equally making it appear white . Just like snow . Primarily the eye color is based on the density and distribution of melanin in the eye . It just looks a certain color when light illuminates the eye . It reflects light unequally .', \"The pigmentation of the iris determines color and this is inherited genetically . Pigmentation in humans is caused by the level of melanin in the skin . Since pigmentation is affected by levels of light exposure , it can be assumed there 's a connection . But as far as I know we do n't have any idea as to why eyes are exactly the colors that they are .\"]   \n",
              "8      ['EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent \\'s turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it \\'s not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n\\'t stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n\\'t stay ahead of the enemy \\'s attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they \\'re designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n\\'t get the combo out in time or ca n\\'t protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n\\'t get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro\\'d ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you \\'re playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it \\'s a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player \\'s personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n\\'t win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder \\'s toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I \\'ve only been playing for a year or so , and I do n\\'t actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I \\'m planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I \\'ll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .', \"Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .\", \"Something that I find helps understand the game a great deal : Richard Garfield , pHD made the game as an economics paper . He wanted to see how people allocate resources , but also loved Dungeons and Dragons . If you look at the first set , you have your initial creatures of each color as an Angel ( W ) , Dragon ( R ) , Wurm ( G ) , Djinn ( U ) and Vampire ( B ) . The mana sources were played once a turn , and how you used it mattered . You could use your one mana to play a creature , or allocate those resources towards something else . You could destroy someone 's ability to produce resources . You can avoid creatures ( monsters ) all together . As the game progressed , it branched out greatly from basic D & D. Now we have entire sets of cards dedicated to a single mythos . We had 2013 as a Greek mythology themed sets , complete with gods interacting with mortals , two years before that we had a whole set of gothic horror complete with werewolves , giests and families of elitist vampires . The game has thousands of cards , some extremely valuable , some not , but it all started to see if we could attach some modicum of economics to D & D.\"]   \n",

It's important to get any injury checked out by a medical professional, especially if you're experiencing pain or swelling. Hard lumps can sometimes be a sign of a more serious injury or condition, such as a fracture or a cyst.\\n\\nIf you haven't already done so, it's a good idea to make an appointment with a doctor or a physiotherapist to have your injury evaluated. They will be able to assess the lump and determine the cause. Depending on the cause, they may recommend treatment options, such as ice, rest, elevation, physical therapy, or medications.\\n\\nIt's also important to take care of your ankle while you're on your long-distance flight. Try to avoid standing for long periods of time, and wear comfortable shoes that provide support for your feet. If you need to elevate your foot, you can use a footrest or a small pillow. Avoiding prolonged periods of inactivity can also help reduce swelling.\\n\\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.\"]   \n",

      ['There are several possible causes of a painless lump in the right arm near the shoulder. Some of the most common causes include:\\n\\nLipoma: A lipoma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor made up of fat cells. It is typically soft, painless, and movable.\\n\\nCyst: A cyst is a sac-like structure that can contain fluid, pus, or other substances. Cysts can occur anywhere on the body and are usually painless.\\n\\nGanglion cyst: A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled sac that often appears on the wrist, hand, or foot. It can also occur in other areas of the body, including the arm. Ganglion cysts are usually painless and movable.\\n\\nBursitis: Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae (small fluid-filled sacs) that cushion and protect the joints. Bursitis can cause a lump and discomfort in the shoulder area.\\n\\nIt is important to see a doctor if you have a lump in your arm that is persistent or bothersome. The doctor will be able to determine the cause of the lump and recommend appropriate treatment.']   \n",

There are several things you can try to alleviate the pain:\\n\\nTake a break from standing or walking and rest in a comfortable position.\\n\\nApply heat or cold to the affected area. Heat can help to relax tense muscles, while cold can help to reduce inflammation.\\n\\nTry stretching or massaging the affected muscles.\\n\\nOver-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, may also be helpful in reducing pain and inflammation.\\n\\nIt is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing persistent or severe pain, as they can help to determine the underlying cause and suggest appropriate treatment options.\\n\\nIt is not necessarily abnormal to experience back pain at your age, but it is important to address any ongoing pain to ensure that it does not worsen over time.']   \n",

Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads .

That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .\", \"HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .\", \"There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .\"]</td>\n",

              "      <td>['EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent \\'s turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it \\'s not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n\\'t stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n\\'t stay ahead of the enemy \\'s attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they \\'re designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n\\'t get the combo out in time or ca n\\'t protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n\\'t get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro\\'d ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you \\'re playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it \\'s a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player \\'s personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D &amp; D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n\\'t win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder \\'s toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I \\'ve only been playing for a year or so , and I do n\\'t actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I \\'m planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I \\'ll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .', \"Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .\", \"Something that I find helps understand the game a great deal : Richard Garfield , pHD made the game as an economics paper . He wanted to see how people allocate resources , but also loved Dungeons and Dragons . If you look at the first set , you have your initial creatures of each color as an Angel ( W ) , Dragon ( R ) , Wurm ( G ) , Djinn ( U ) and Vampire ( B ) . The mana sources were played once a turn , and how you used it mattered . You could use your one mana to play a creature , or allocate those resources towards something else . You could destroy someone 's ability to produce resources . You can avoid creatures ( monsters ) all together . As the game progressed , it branched out greatly from basic D &amp; D. Now we have entire sets of cards dedicated to a single mythos . We had 2013 as a Greek mythology themed sets , complete with gods interacting with mortals , two years before that we had a whole set of gothic horror complete with werewolves , giests and families of elitist vampires . The game has thousands of cards , some extremely valuable , some not , but it all started to see if we could attach some modicum of economics to D &amp; D.\"]</td>\n",

You will also need to provide proof of identification, such as a passport, and evidence of your residence in the UK, such as a visa or a rental agreement.Once you have opened a brokerage account, you will be able to buy and sell stocks and other securities listed on the London Stock Exchange, just like a resident of the UK. However, you may be subject to certain restrictions or requirements, such as taxes on your investments or reporting requirements, depending on the tax rules of your home country and the type of visa you hold.It is important to note that investing in the stock market involves risks, and you should carefully consider your financial situation and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. You should also seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions, as the appropriateness of a particular investment will depend on your individual circumstances.', 'Yes, you can invest in the London stock market if you are a resident on a visa.

Today it is prohibited by the Limited Test Ban Treaty . As a result the USA , USSR / Russia , and UK have not tested underwater weapons since the 1960s . ( France and China did not sign the LTBT until much later ; I do n't know if they did any underwater tests after that period . ) India , Pakistan , and North Korea have only tested their weapons underground . As for the radiation , much of it gets absorbed into the water , which does get highly radioactive . However the ocean is very large and so that diffuses to non - harmful levels in a relatively short amount of time . As for killing lots of animals , sure — that happens all the time . In many ways it is better than detonating them on land , because that produces long - range , harmful radioactive fallout when the dirt mixes with the radioactive fireball . Underwater testing actually produces very little fallout outside of the immediate area of the test . It is worth distinguishing between true underwater tests and those which are on coral atolls . Atolls are a terrible place to set off nuclear weapons from a fallout concern ; actual underwater tests are not so bad . Who 's going to not allow it ? International laws are really just agreements that the majority of nations accept and comply with . There is no international body capable of forcing countries to obey , short of the UN Security Council agreeing to drop bombs - and that happens extremely rarely because the members of the Council vote how their governments tell them to . Japanese whaling is a perfect example . There is an international law , but the law allows science , so Japan claims it needs to harvest thousands of whales every year for science . And no one can stop them . The ocean is * really really really really god - damn BIG * . It would take quite a blast to cause a noticeable difference on anything larger than a local scale . A - Bombs are n't great for life , you are correct , but as long as we do n't detonate a bunch of them all over we can minimize the damage .   \n",

Mary 's a baker , John 's a wheat farmer . Therefore , Mary often buys wheat , John often sells it . Now , John has two problems : 1 . How does he plan how much wheat to grow during the season ? If he grows too much , he will have spent too much money on seed , fertilizer , etc . If he grows too little , he will not have earned as much money as he could have . 2 . Suppose he makes his plan , grows the wheat , but then at when it 's ready , the price of wheat has dropped a lot . In this case , he may lose money — or at least not make the profit he expected . Mary also has a problem . She makes most of her money from wedding cakes . Everybody gets married in the same season , but they want to know the price of the cake six months before the wedding . But Mary does n't know how much wheat will cost when she makes the cakes — so if she gives a quote with current wheat prices , and the price goes up , she may end up losing money . There 's a way to solve all of these problems in one shot : John and Mary come to an agreement where Mary will buy John 's wheat 6 months from now , but at today 's wheat price . This way , John knows how much wheat to grow and how much he will be paid for it , and Mary knows how much she will pay for her wheat as well . Well , futures trading is basically what you get when you recognize that this idea can be improved by making it work like sports betting : * We have a bookie ( the futures exchange ) that takes bets on the price of wheat — always taking a bit off the top as payment . * Mary figures out how much wheat she will need , and then she goes to the bookie and offers a bet that wheat prices will go up . The size of the bet is based on how much wheat she will need , and she wins or loses money proportionate to how far the price ends up from today 's price . So now , if wheat goes up she loses on the cakes but makes up for it by the earnings of the bet . ( If wheat goes down , she loses on her bet but spends less on the wheat for the cakes . ) * John goes to the bookie as well , sees Mary 's offered bet , and accepts the other side of it — he bets that wheat prices will go down . He uses the amount of Mary 's ( and other people 's ) bets to plan how much wheat to grow . That way he does n't grow too much wheat , and if wheat prices actually go down , he makes less on his wheat but wins it back from the bet . So that achieves the same thing as the first solution , but Mary and John did n't even need to know about each other — they just deal with a common third party ( the bookie / futures exchange ) . Futures are much more a finance term than an economics term . Futures are just a promise to deliver something at a future date . Almost all business contracts are like future contracts in that they settle in the future . Futures markets just standardize the terms so that many people can participate . So for example a futures contract might be to deliver 5,000 bushels of wheat in August . A farmer could sell 20 contracts and plan with knowledge that his revenue will be relatively fixed . A baker could buy 5 contracts in August , November , February , and May and plan knowing that he only needs warehousing space for 25,000 bushels of wheat and what his grain prices would be for the year . A speculator can buy from the farmer and sell to the baker because he can compare the two prices with the cost of holding 80,000 bushels of wheat . In this way everyone who trades can be made better off ( and people who would be made worse off do n't trade ) . You 're selling goods that will be presumably made later . If I 'm a farmer I want to know I can sell my crop before it rots in the silo or whatever so I might sell my crop of corn before it 's even matured yet just to make sure I will sell all of it . The benefit to the farmer is knowing that they 'll sell and for how much , and the benefit for the buyer is knowing they have a certain amount they 'll receive and at what cost . Working it out when the corn is sitting on the stalk waiting for harvest , and especially working it out when it 's harvested and sitting around , can be a bit hectic .   \n",

This is basically a huge version of the small bubbles that would normally stick to you under water . If you move around enough eventually all of the air will be dislodged and you 'll be covered in water just like normal . A hydrophobic surface does n't stop water touching it but it does stop water from sticking to it . When you got out of the pool you would be instantly dry , all of the water would fall away immediately . Your skin would not get wet ; you might have some difficulty breathing , depending on how deep this pool is , and your orientation therein . You 'd float about the same as you normally would . Hydrophobic coatings just repel water — they prevent \" wetting \" . Think of it this way : technically , hydrophobics do n't repel water . Rather , water prefers sticking to itself so much that it avoids non - polar chemicals . A single molecule of water in oil does n't avoid the oil at all . But add two molecules of water , and put them near each other , and they 'll want to find each other and stick together . Put enough water there , and they 'll bunch together so well that they 'll push the oil away . So , no . You would not be covered by a layer of air , or anything else of the sort ( maybe a few bubbles , but certainly not a layer ) . When you got back out , the water would continue it 's plan to stick to itself . Mostly , it would be in drops big enough to roll off of you . Some smaller droplets would remain .   \n",

To maintain a nuclear deterrent , it is necessary to be able to wipe out your adversary with only a portion of it . They built a ton during the Cold War , trying to one up each other . Now , they 're really hard to get rid of . The size of the US and Russian stockpiles are , at this point , largely linked to the size of the US and Russian stockpiles . Which sounds circular , because it is . Let me explain . The US stockpile is large because it is meant to counter - balance the Russian stockpile . The Russian stockpile is large because it is meant to counter - balance the US stockpile . To reduce both stockpiles meaningfully , they have to be simultaneously reduced . Both sides have been steadily reducing their strategic weapons over the years since the end of the Cold War . The Russians have maintained a much larger stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons ( small weapons with limited range ) than the United States , so their stockpile looks much larger on the face of it . What 's the minimum stockpile size for security ? It 's not clear . Advocates of a \" minimum deterrence \" — e.g. just enough nukes to threaten someone who also has nukes into not using their — usually suggest that it is between 200 - 1,000 or so . The US currently has around 5,000 so there is still some room to go if that 's the magic number . But determining that number is not straightforward . And it 's not clear the Russians are interested in going that low either . How 'd they get so large in the first place ? The US started building nukes by the tens of thousands during the Cold War both to deter the Soviets and to counter - balance against Soviet conventional forces . The USSR struggled to catch up and eventually did by the 1970s . Then both nations had a whole lot of bombs . Since then both have reduced their stockpiles considerably but a percentage of a large number is still a large number .   \n",

It 's the reason hugs where invented . That 's what I think is happening , Scientific America thinks otherwise . \" During a particularly stressful experience , the anterior cingulate cortex may respond by increasing the activity of the vagus nerve — the nerve that starts in the brain stem and connects to the neck , chest and abdomen . When the vagus nerve is overstimulated , it can cause pain and nausea . \" URL_0 Next question is why does the body do that ? Is it preparing to defend itself in some way ? Seems pretty counter - productive . Humans have a very developed emotional life ( though amazingly , less than that of an orca ! ) , and feelings are expressed through our bodies moreso than our minds . When we feel an emotion but can not or do not express it , it remains stored in various parts of our bodies , particularly in our chests . We also tend to hold tension , ie stress , sadness , anger etc . in shoulders , hips , jaw . I do not have a ' why ' answer , only that this is as it is .

If nobody wants to buy it ( perhaps because the company is tanking ) , then the share prices fall until they 're cheap enough that someone 's willing to buy . If you look at a level two stock quotes , for example ( here ) [ URL_0 ] , you will notice that there are a large number of existing asks and bids , and they are constantly changing . That is , there are already people out there offering to buy and sell stocks at different amounts and different size blocks . When you buy or sell stocks you can either do a market buy / sell ( which means you find the best price currently being offered and execute the trade with that person ) , or you can do a limit buy / sell ( which means you put out your own ask / bid and wait for someone else to buy it at the price you set ) . The price reported in the market is the price of the last trade . When a stock tanks , it means that the most recent sale was much lower than sales before it , but nothing more . For example , imagine a million persons each own one share , and they 're all trying to sell it at the same time . But only 100 people are willing to buy a share , and they only will do so at a low price . As soon as one of the million sellers agrees to sell at a low price , the market reports this as the new price — but the other 999,999 sellers still have n't sold their stock !   \n",
              "48327  You might as well just read this URL_1 Short summary ; it 's bullshit . Long summary . It works as effectively as getting a massage from your friend . A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that collectively , spinal manipulation failed to show it is effective for any condition.[14 ] A 2008 critical review found that with the possible exception of back pain , chiropractic manipulation has not been shown to be effective for any medical condition.[9 ] Health claims made by chiropractors regarding use of manipulation for pediatric health conditions are supported by only low levels of scientific evidence[95][133 ] that does not demonstrate clinically relevant benefits For more info , see this QuackWatch Chiropractic website Your Skeptical Guide to Chiropractic History , Theories , and Practices Operated by Stephen Barrett , MD , and Samuel Homola \" URL_0 A spinal surgeon I know likes to say that he 'd be out of work if it was not for the chiropractors . There are three main schools of chiropractics : straight , \" mixer \" , and reform / rational . Straight chiropractors use [ Daniel David Palmer ] ( URL_1 ) 's original theory that subluxations of the spine blocking the flow of nerve energy cause the majority of human ailments ( subluxations in other places are the cause of the rest ) . As D. D. Palmer 's son Bartlett Joshua Palmer wrote : > Chiropractors have found in every disease that is supposed to be contagious , a cause in the spine . In the spinal column we will find a subluxation that corresponds to every type of disease . If we had one hundred cases of small - pox , I can prove to you where , in one , you will find a subluxation and you will find the same conditions in the other ninety - nine . I adjust one and return his functions to normal ... . There is no contagious disease ... . There is no infection ... . There is a cause internal to man that makes of his body in a certain spot , more or less a breeding ground [ for microbes ] . It is a place where they can multiply , propagate , and then because they become so many they are classed as a cause . D. D. Palmer later went on to say that the vast majority of spinal subluxations are caused by a dislocation of the first cervical bone ( the atlas ) and that manipulating the atlas would fix everything . This is the \" all - in - one \" ( AIO ) sub school of straight chiropractors . The chiropractor I went to for a while was a straight chiropractor . I got the full spinal x - rays and was diagnosed as having allergies and gas in my stomach due to spinal alignment . He used the [ Meric system ] ( URL_0 ) which assigns a specific ailment to a specific cervical bone . I stopped going after he popped my neck and I got a sudden noise in my ears and could n't hear anything over the noise for a few days and it caused pain to hear sounds louder than a whisper . Most chiropractors are \" mixers \" ( a name give as an insult by straight chiropractors ) in that they mix spinal manipulation with other therapy like vitamin therapy , herbalism , and homeopathy . Beyond that , there is little difference from straight chiropractors in terms of theory — \" mixer \" chiropractors believe that subluxations block the flow of nerve energy and that unblocking the nerve will allow the body to heal itself but that the additional technique help the body heal itself in other ways . My aunt was a \" mixer \" . She 's now a librarian . The third and smallest school are reform or rational chiropractors . They use the scientific method and limit their practice to scientifically demonstrated techniques and generally limit the claims of chiropractic manipulation to being able to solve back pain issues and will refer you for surgery and will recommend medications . They are looked down upon by the straights and mixers as having sold out to the medical industry that is pushing expensive surgeries and medications . Now , there 's a reason my aunt is no longer a practicing chiropractor . Being a librarian pays more . A lot of insurance companies wo n't pay for chiropractics because of the lack of scientific evidence . If you take an x - ray of a spine and show it to a dozen chiropractors , they 'll all point out subluxations … in different locations . Plus , they wo n't agree on the optimal alignment of the spine . That is why the \" mixer \" school of chiropractics is so popular — the other forms of therapy brought in more money than straight chiropractics . Straight chiropractors will tell you the lack of scientific evidence for chiropractics is due to mainstream journals refusing their papers due to a conspiracy by Big Pharma and Big Medical .   \n",

A super - majority of the members of the 65th Congress favored prohibition -- but that was really an oddity . Many in politics opposed prohibition , and anti - prohibitionists might retake a majority at any time . The temperance movement enacted a constitutional ban to ensure that , without a 2/3 majority , Congress could n't repeal the ban on the sale , transport , and manufacture of alcohol . Opponents of prohibition also preferred the constitutional ban -- because it did n't include any provisions for enforcement . They thought they could deliver prohibitionists a moral victory , while still using their power to block good enforcement . Ultimately , they succeeded -- alcohol was banned , but everyone still drank . Of course , this ended out being a huge disaster , but that 's another matter . Daniel Okrant 's * Last Call : The Rise and Fall of Prohibition * details the nitty - gritty of the prohibition battle including the risk that Congress might repeal . For the record , Congress claims the authority to regulate drugs today under the interstate commerce clause , given that most drugs include components traded across state lines , or are sold across state lines , or are sold by groups that operate across state lines , etc . etc . etc . See * United States v. Lopez * for more information . Watch Ken Burns ' documentary Prohibition , it details the long and complicated story of the social issues that lead to prohibition . In short , alcoholism was a huge huge huge problem , women had no control over finances which went straight to the husband 's booze , and hard spirits like rum replaced softer ale and beer as the drink of choice . This was one of the first issues that women felt they could use to gain power outside the home , and it actually helped give them the confidence to pursue gaining the vote , and from there they used that power to vote in dry politicians . The wet politicians never believed prohibition would succeed and sort of treated it as a joke . Clearly , they were n't laughing in the end . But seriously this is not something explainable to a five year old , watch the first part of the documentary . Edit : as for a constitutional ban vs a simple bill , they believed it was their moral obligation to obliterate alcohol , and the only way to ensure all states permanently went dry was to pursue it via the Constitution . Every answer in this thread is wrong . It is n't a hard one . Wickard v. Filburn was the Supreme Court case that did it . It made anything interstate commerce , which then allowed regulation . Previous to that case the government did n't have the right to regulate it , thus needed an amendment . Edit : URL_1 URL_0 > The government also contended that consuming one 's locally grown marijuana for medical purposes affects the interstate market of marijuana , and hence that the federal government may regulate — and prohibit — such consumption . This argument stems from the landmark New Deal case Wickard v. Filburn , which held that the government may regulate personal cultivation and consumption of crops , due to the aggregate effect of individual consumption on the government 's legitimate statutory framework governing the interstate wheat market . It is important to note that the first ban was n't technically a ban ... The marihuana tax act was passed in 1937 made it so that people needed a tax stamp to grow it and sell it , the government just refused to give anyone the stamp , effectively making it illegal . They could n't actually make it illegal until after Wickard passed . In 1969 the tax act was ruled unconstitutional , so congress passed the controlled substances act to replace it .

The basic principle coming out of R.A.V. v. St. Paul ( 1992 ) is that the government can not prohibit speech based on the * content * of the message . For example , trying to ban Neo - Nazis from holding demonstrations would boil down to the government banning them because they disapprove of what they are saying . Now , it 's perfect correct for citizens to disapprove of Neo - Nazism , but it 's not for the government to bring the force of law down upon them because , if we do , we have now entered the slippery slope of deciding what people can say based on the majority . We ban Neo - Nazi speech because we do n't like it . What happens if the majority does n't like Pro - gay rights speech ? Or pro - evolutionary theory speech ? We allow hate speech because it 's not the job of the government to tell us what we are and are n't allowed to say . It 's up to the citizens to individually decide what 's appropriate . > Speech is powerful . It can stir people to action , move them to tears of both joy and sorrow , and — as it did here — inflict great pain . On the facts before us , we can not react to that pain by punishing the speaker . As a Nation we have chosen a different course — to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate . > Snyder v. Phelps ( 2011 ) Hate speech is constitutional . Nearly everything you say is constitutionally protected ( from state action ) . This protection extends to hate speech . But one situation where hate speech ( or any speech for that matter ) is * not * constitutionally protected is where it creates some sort of * immediate * danger to individuals . The common example is , \" You ca n't yell ' fire ' in a crowded theater . \" So consider the following examples : * You say \" I hate Japs . \" That 's constitutional . The government * generally * ca n't stop you from saying that . * You say \" I hate Japs . So let 's draw our guns and grease all the slopes in this city \" to an excited crowd in a public place . That 's not constitutionally protected . You 're inciting a race riot . The government can intervene and shut you down . It 's unclear whether you mean * constitutional * or * unconstitutional * .   \n",

              "      <td>At the time it was done , it was not prohibited by any treaty . Today it is prohibited by the Limited Test Ban Treaty . As a result the USA , USSR / Russia , and UK have not tested underwater weapons since the 1960s . ( France and China did not sign the LTBT until much later ; I do n't know if they did any underwater tests after that period . ) India , Pakistan , and North Korea have only tested their weapons underground . As for the radiation , much of it gets absorbed into the water , which does get highly radioactive . However the ocean is very large and so that diffuses to non - harmful levels in a relatively short amount of time . As for killing lots of animals , sure — that happens all the time . In many ways it is better than detonating them on land , because that produces long - range , harmful radioactive fallout when the dirt mixes with the radioactive fireball . Underwater testing actually produces very little fallout outside of the immediate area of the test . It is worth distinguishing between true underwater tests and those which are on coral atolls . Atolls are a terrible place to set off nuclear weapons from a fallout concern ; actual underwater tests are not so bad . Who 's going to not allow it ? International laws are really just agreements that the majority of nations accept and comply with . There is no international body capable of forcing countries to obey , short of the UN Security Council agreeing to drop bombs - and that happens extremely rarely because the members of the Council vote how their governments tell them to . Japanese whaling is a perfect example . There is an international law , but the law allows science , so Japan claims it needs to harvest thousands of whales every year for science . And no one can stop them . The ocean is * really really really really god - damn BIG * . It would take quite a blast to cause a noticeable difference on anything larger than a local scale . A - Bombs are n't great for life , you are correct , but as long as we do n't detonate a bunch of them all over we can minimize the damage .</td>\n",

              "      <td>Suppose there 's two persons : Mary Baker and John Farmer . Mary 's a baker , John 's a wheat farmer . Therefore , Mary often buys wheat , John often sells it . Now , John has two problems : 1 . How does he plan how much wheat to grow during the season ? If he grows too much , he will have spent too much money on seed , fertilizer , etc . If he grows too little , he will not have earned as much money as he could have . 2 . Suppose he makes his plan , grows the wheat , but then at when it 's ready , the price of wheat has dropped a lot . In this case , he may lose money — or at least not make the profit he expected . Mary also has a problem . She makes most of her money from wedding cakes . Everybody gets married in the same season , but they want to know the price of the cake six months before the wedding . But Mary does n't know how much wheat will cost when she makes the cakes — so if she gives a quote with current wheat prices , and the price goes up , she may end up losing money . There 's a way to solve all of these problems in one shot : John and Mary come to an agreement where Mary will buy John 's wheat 6 months from now , but at today 's wheat price . This way , John knows how much wheat to grow and how much he will be paid for it , and Mary knows how much she will pay for her wheat as well . Well , futures trading is basically what you get when you recognize that this idea can be improved by making it work like sports betting : * We have a bookie ( the futures exchange ) that takes bets on the price of wheat — always taking a bit off the top as payment . * Mary figures out how much wheat she will need , and then she goes to the bookie and offers a bet that wheat prices will go up . The size of the bet is based on how much wheat she will need , and she wins or loses money proportionate to how far the price ends up from today 's price . So now , if wheat goes up she loses on the cakes but makes up for it by the earnings of the bet . ( If wheat goes down , she loses on her bet but spends less on the wheat for the cakes . ) * John goes to the bookie as well , sees Mary 's offered bet , and accepts the other side of it — he bets that wheat prices will go down . He uses the amount of Mary 's ( and other people 's ) bets to plan how much wheat to grow . That way he does n't grow too much wheat , and if wheat prices actually go down , he makes less on his wheat but wins it back from the bet . So that achieves the same thing as the first solution , but Mary and John did n't even need to know about each other — they just deal with a common third party ( the bookie / futures exchange ) . Futures are much more a finance term than an economics term . Futures are just a promise to deliver something at a future date . Almost all business contracts are like future contracts in that they settle in the future . Futures markets just standardize the terms so that many people can participate . So for example a futures contract might be to deliver 5,000 bushels of wheat in August . A farmer could sell 20 contracts and plan with knowledge that his revenue will be relatively fixed . A baker could buy 5 contracts in August , November , February , and May and plan knowing that he only needs warehousing space for 25,000 bushels of wheat and what his grain prices would be for the year . A speculator can buy from the farmer and sell to the baker because he can compare the two prices with the cost of holding 80,000 bushels of wheat . In this way everyone who trades can be made better off ( and people who would be made worse off do n't trade ) . You 're selling goods that will be presumably made later . If I 'm a farmer I want to know I can sell my crop before it rots in the silo or whatever so I might sell my crop of corn before it 's even matured yet just to make sure I will sell all of it . The benefit to the farmer is knowing that they 'll sell and for how much , and the benefit for the buyer is knowing they have a certain amount they 'll receive and at what cost . Working it out when the corn is sitting on the stalk waiting for harvest , and especially working it out when it 's harvested and sitting around , can be a bit hectic .</td>\n",

The Russian stockpile is large because it is meant to counter - balance the US stockpile . To reduce both stockpiles meaningfully , they have to be simultaneously reduced . Both sides have been steadily reducing their strategic weapons over the years since the end of the Cold War . The Russians have maintained a much larger stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons ( small weapons with limited range ) than the United States , so their stockpile looks much larger on the face of it . What 's the minimum stockpile size for security ? It 's not clear . Advocates of a \" minimum deterrence \" — e.g. just enough nukes to threaten someone who also has nukes into not using their — usually suggest that it is between 200 - 1,000 or so . The US currently has around 5,000 so there is still some room to go if that 's the magic number . But determining that number is not straightforward . And it 's not clear the Russians are interested in going that low either . How 'd they get so large in the first place ? The US started building nukes by the tens of thousands during the Cold War both to deter the Soviets and to counter - balance against Soviet conventional forces . The USSR struggled to catch up and eventually did by the 1970s . Then both nations had a whole lot of bombs . Since then both have reduced their stockpiles considerably but a percentage of a large number is still a large number .</td>\n",

A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that collectively , spinal manipulation failed to show it is effective for any condition.[14 ] A 2008 critical review found that with the possible exception of back pain , chiropractic manipulation has not been shown to be effective for any medical condition.[9 ] Health claims made by chiropractors regarding use of manipulation for pediatric health conditions are supported by only low levels of scientific evidence[95][133 ] that does not demonstrate clinically relevant benefits For more info , see this QuackWatch Chiropractic website Your Skeptical Guide to Chiropractic History , Theories , and Practices Operated by Stephen Barrett , MD , and Samuel Homola \" URL_0 A spinal surgeon I know likes to say that he 'd be out of work if it was not for the chiropractors . There are three main schools of chiropractics : straight , \" mixer \" , and reform / rational . Straight chiropractors use [ Daniel David Palmer ] ( URL_1 ) 's original theory that subluxations of the spine blocking the flow of nerve energy cause the majority of human ailments ( subluxations in other places are the cause of the rest ) . As D. D. Palmer 's son Bartlett Joshua Palmer wrote : &gt; Chiropractors have found in every disease that is supposed to be contagious , a cause in the spine . In the spinal column we will find a subluxation that corresponds to every type of disease . If we had one hundred cases of small - pox , I can prove to you where , in one , you will find a subluxation and you will find the same conditions in the other ninety - nine . I adjust one and return his functions to normal ... . There is no contagious disease ... . There is no infection ... . There is a cause internal to man that makes of his body in a certain spot , more or less a breeding ground [ for microbes ] . It is a place where they can multiply , propagate , and then because they become so many they are classed as a cause . D. D. Palmer later went on to say that the vast majority of spinal subluxations are caused by a dislocation of the first cervical bone ( the atlas ) and that manipulating the atlas would fix everything . This is the \" all - in - one \" ( AIO ) sub school of straight chiropractors . The chiropractor I went to for a while was a straight chiropractor . I got the full spinal x - rays and was diagnosed as having allergies and gas in my stomach due to spinal alignment . He used the [ Meric system ] ( URL_0 ) which assigns a specific ailment to a specific cervical bone . I stopped going after he popped my neck and I got a sudden noise in my ears and could n't hear anything over the noise for a few days and it caused pain to hear sounds louder than a whisper . Most chiropractors are \" mixers \" ( a name give as an insult by straight chiropractors ) in that they mix spinal manipulation with other therapy like vitamin therapy , herbalism , and homeopathy . Beyond that , there is little difference from straight chiropractors in terms of theory — \" mixer \" chiropractors believe that subluxations block the flow of nerve energy and that unblocking the nerve will allow the body to heal itself but that the additional technique help the body heal itself in other ways . My aunt was a \" mixer \" . She 's now a librarian . The third and smallest school are reform or rational chiropractors . They use the scientific method and limit their practice to scientifically demonstrated techniques and generally limit the claims of chiropractic manipulation to being able to solve back pain issues and will refer you for surgery and will recommend medications . They are looked down upon by the straights and mixers as having sold out to the medical industry that is pushing expensive surgeries and medications . Now , there 's a reason my aunt is no longer a practicing chiropractor . Being a librarian pays more . A lot of insurance companies wo n't pay for chiropractics because of the lack of scientific evidence . If you take an x - ray of a spine and show it to a dozen chiropractors , they 'll all point out subluxations … in different locations . Plus , they wo n't agree on the optimal alignment of the spine . That is why the \" mixer \" school of chiropractics is so popular — the other forms of therapy brought in more money than straight chiropractics . Straight chiropractors will tell you the lack of scientific evidence for chiropractics is due to mainstream journals refusing their papers due to a conspiracy by Big Pharma and Big Medical .</td>\n",

              "      <td>The temperance movement sought a constitutional ban , not a legal ban , so as to prevent the ban from being easily repealed . A super - majority of the members of the 65th Congress favored prohibition -- but that was really an oddity . Many in politics opposed prohibition , and anti - prohibitionists might retake a majority at any time . The temperance movement enacted a constitutional ban to ensure that , without a 2/3 majority , Congress could n't repeal the ban on the sale , transport , and manufacture of alcohol . Opponents of prohibition also preferred the constitutional ban -- because it did n't include any provisions for enforcement . They thought they could deliver prohibitionists a moral victory , while still using their power to block good enforcement . Ultimately , they succeeded -- alcohol was banned , but everyone still drank . Of course , this ended out being a huge disaster , but that 's another matter . Daniel Okrant 's * Last Call : The Rise and Fall of Prohibition * details the nitty - gritty of the prohibition battle including the risk that Congress might repeal . For the record , Congress claims the authority to regulate drugs today under the interstate commerce clause , given that most drugs include components traded across state lines , or are sold across state lines , or are sold by groups that operate across state lines , etc . etc . etc . See * United States v. Lopez * for more information . Watch Ken Burns ' documentary Prohibition , it details the long and complicated story of the social issues that lead to prohibition . In short , alcoholism was a huge huge huge problem , women had no control over finances which went straight to the husband 's booze , and hard spirits like rum replaced softer ale and beer as the drink of choice . This was one of the first issues that women felt they could use to gain power outside the home , and it actually helped give them the confidence to pursue gaining the vote , and from there they used that power to vote in dry politicians . The wet politicians never believed prohibition would succeed and sort of treated it as a joke . Clearly , they were n't laughing in the end . But seriously this is not something explainable to a five year old , watch the first part of the documentary . Edit : as for a constitutional ban vs a simple bill , they believed it was their moral obligation to obliterate alcohol , and the only way to ensure all states permanently went dry was to pursue it via the Constitution . Every answer in this thread is wrong . It is n't a hard one . Wickard v. Filburn was the Supreme Court case that did it . It made anything interstate commerce , which then allowed regulation . Previous to that case the government did n't have the right to regulate it , thus needed an amendment . Edit : URL_1 URL_0 &gt; The government also contended that consuming one 's locally grown marijuana for medical purposes affects the interstate market of marijuana , and hence that the federal government may regulate — and prohibit — such consumption . This argument stems from the landmark New Deal case Wickard v. Filburn , which held that the government may regulate personal cultivation and consumption of crops , due to the aggregate effect of individual consumption on the government 's legitimate statutory framework governing the interstate wheat market . It is important to note that the first ban was n't technically a ban ... The marihuana tax act was passed in 1937 made it so that people needed a tax stamp to grow it and sell it , the government just refused to give anyone the stamp , effectively making it illegal . They could n't actually make it illegal until after Wickard passed . In 1969 the tax act was ruled unconstitutional , so congress passed the controlled substances act to replace it .

St. Paul ( 1992 ) is that the government can not prohibit speech based on the * content * of the message . For example , trying to ban Neo - Nazis from holding demonstrations would boil down to the government banning them because they disapprove of what they are saying . Now , it 's perfect correct for citizens to disapprove of Neo - Nazism , but it 's not for the government to bring the force of law down upon them because , if we do , we have now entered the slippery slope of deciding what people can say based on the majority . We ban Neo - Nazi speech because we do n't like it . What happens if the majority does n't like Pro - gay rights speech ? Or pro - evolutionary theory speech ? We allow hate speech because it 's not the job of the government to tell us what we are and are n't allowed to say . It 's up to the citizens to individually decide what 's appropriate . &gt; Speech is powerful . It can stir people to action , move them to tears of both joy and sorrow , and — as it did here — inflict great pain . On the facts before us , we can not react to that pain by punishing the speaker . As a Nation we have chosen a different course — to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate . &gt; Snyder v. Phelps ( 2011 ) Hate speech is constitutional . Nearly everything you say is constitutionally protected ( from state action ) . This protection extends to hate speech . But one situation where hate speech ( or any speech for that matter ) is * not * constitutionally protected is where it creates some sort of * immediate * danger to individuals . The common example is , \" You ca n't yell ' fire ' in a crowded theater . \" So consider the following examples : * You say \" I hate Japs . \" That 's constitutional . The government * generally * ca n't stop you from saying that . * You say \" I hate Japs . So let 's draw our guns and grease all the slopes in this city \" to an excited crowd in a public place . That 's not constitutionally protected . You 're inciting a race riot . The government can intervene and shut you down .

You might find a nice surprise.  Your tax professional can also help you to report the items properly if mis-reported. Much of this is in the article you cite in the question, but perhaps a look at some of the original sources is warranted and will show why some expert advice might be useful.  I would argue that an RA who is required to police and counsel undergrads in a college dorm in exchange for a room or a flat is closer to a worker with quarters on a ship or at an oil well than a full professor who receives a rental home in a neighborhood near the university as a benefit.  In the first case living at the provided premises is necessary to do the job, but in the second case it is merely a benefit of the job.   The IRS Publication 15-B guidance on employer provided housing  is not entirely clear, so you might want to get some additional advice: Lodging on Your Business Premises You can exclude the value of lodging   you furnish to an employee from the employee's wages if it meets the   following tests. It is furnished on your business premises. It is furnished for your convenience. The employee must accept it as a condition of employment. Different tests may apply to lodging furnished by educational   institutions. See section 119(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for   details. If you allow your employee to choose to receive additional pay instead   of lodging, then the lodging, if chosen, isn\\u2019t excluded. The exclusion   also doesn't apply to cash allowances for lodging. On your business premises.   For this exclusion, your business   premises is generally your employee's place of work. For example, if   you're a household employer, then lodging furnished in your home to a   household employee would be considered lodging furnished on your   business premises. For special rules that apply to lodging furnished   in a camp located in a foreign country, see section 119(c) of the   Internal Revenue Code and its regulations.  For your convenience.   Whether or not you furnish lodging for your convenience as an employer   depends on all the facts and circumstances. You furnish the lodging to   your employee for your convenience if you do this for a substantial   business reason other than to provide the employee with additional   pay. This is true even if a law or an employment contract provides   that the lodging is furnished as pay. However, a written statement   that the lodging is furnished for your convenience isn't sufficient. Condition of employment.   Lodging meets this test if you require your   employees to accept the lodging because they need to live on your   business premises to be able to properly perform their duties.   Examples include employees who must be available at all times and   employees who couldn't perform their required duties without being   furnished the lodging.   It doesn't matter whether you must furnish   the lodging as pay under the terms of an employment contract or a law   fixing the terms of employment. Example of qualifying lodging. You employ Sam at a construction project at a remote job site in   Alaska. Due to the inaccessibility of facilities for the employees who   are working at the job site to obtain lodging and the prevailing   weather conditions, you furnish lodging to your employees at the   construction site in order to carry on the construction project. You   require that your employees accept the lodging as a condition of their   employment. You may exclude the lodging that you provide from Sam's   wages. Additionally, since sufficient eating facilities aren\\u2019t   available near your place of employment, you may also exclude meals   you provide to Sam from his wages, as discussed under Meals on Your   Business Premises , later in this section. Example of nonqualifying lodging. A hospital gives Joan, an employee of the hospital, the choice of   living at the hospital free of charge or living elsewhere and   receiving a cash allowance in addition to her regular salary. If Joan   chooses to live at the hospital, the hospital can't exclude the value   of the lodging from her wages because she isn't required to live at   the hospital to properly perform the duties of her employment. One question would be how the conflict with IRC 119(d) is resolved for someone who must live in the dorm to watch over the dorm and its undergrads. Here's 26USC119(d) from LII: (d) Lodging furnished by certain educational institutions to employees (1) In general  In the case of an employee of an educational   institution, gross income shall not include the value of qualified   campus lodging furnished to such employee during the taxable year. (2)   Exception in cases of inadequate rent Paragraph (1) shall not apply to   the extent of the excess of\\u2014 (A) the lesser of\\u2014 (i) 5 percent of the   appraised value of the qualified campus lodging, or (ii) the average   of the rentals paid by individuals (other than employees or students   of the educational institution) during such calendar year for lodging   provided by the educational institution which is comparable to the   qualified campus lodging provided to the employee, over (B) the rent   paid by the employee for the qualified campus lodging during such   calendar year. The appraised value under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be   determined as of the close of the calendar year in which the taxable   year begins, or, in the case of a rental period not greater than 1   year, at any time during the calendar year in which such period   begins.  (3) Qualified campus lodging For purposes of this subsection,   the term \\u201cqualified campus lodging\\u201d means lodging to which subsection   (a) does not apply and which is\\u2014 (A) located on, or in the proximity   of, a campus of the educational institution, and (B) furnished to the   employee, his spouse, and any of his dependents by or on behalf of   such institution for use as a residence.  (4) Educational institution, etc. For purposes of this subsection\\u2014 (A) In generalThe term   \\u201ceducational institution\\u201d means\\u2014 (i) an institution described in   section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) (or an entity organized under State law and   composed of public institutions so described), or (ii) an academic   health center. (B) Academic health centerFor purposes of subparagraph   (A), the term \\u201cacademic health center\\u201d means an entity\\u2014 (i) which is   described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii), (ii) which receives (during   the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins)   payments under subsection (d)(5)(B) or (h) of section 1886 of the   Social Security Act (relating to graduate medical education), and   (iii) which has as one of its principal purposes or functions the   providing and teaching of basic and clinical medical science and   research with the entity\\u2019s own faculty.\",\n          \"Part of it has to do with what he told a reporter during a one on one interview . DeBlasio told this reporter that he has been teaching his son Dante , who is bi - racial to be careful around police officers . This led people to think that he is perpetuating the image of the white , racist police officer via the media . Essentially because he takes a nuanced stand on police racial relations and prejudices , tempered by being the father to a black son and his own liberal ethos . Essentially , the police would be happy if we supported them without questioning their actions . So by questioning the use of their authority , he seems , as if he is against the cops . As a New Yorker , I happened to be pretty interested in this situation . I did some legwork to figure out exactly why the Police are so mad . Let 's start from the beginning . * * These are the words he actually said * * [ in regards to the Eric Garner case ] ( URL_4 ): > \\\" This is profoundly personal for me . I was at the White House the other > day , and the president of the United States turned to me , and he met > Dante a few months ago , and he said that Dante reminded him of what > he looked like as a teenager . And he said , I know you see this crisis > through a very personal lens . I said to him I did . Because Chirlane and > I have had to talk to Dante for years , about the dangers he may face . A > good young man , a law - abiding young man , who would never think to > do anything wrong , and yet , because of a history that still hangs over > us , the dangers he may face \\u2014 we\\u2019ve had to literally train him , as > families have all over this city for decades , in how to take special care > in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to > protect him . \\\" That statement seems pretty innocuous , no ? It just says that racial profiling happens and he had to teach his biracial son that its very important to be careful around police officers and to treat them with respect . In response to that came [ the video of Patrick Lynch ] ( URL_0 ) , the head of the Patrolmen \\u2019s Benevolent Association , a police union . I doubt most of the police who turned their backs on DeBlasio know the words they 're protesting . I bet all of them saw or heard about the \\\" Blood on his hands \\\" comment . It just so happens that the Mayor and the [ union are in contract renegotiations for the police force ] ( URL_3 ) - Bloomberg tried to renegotiate , but never settled , and the unions placed the problem on DeBlasio 's lap . The labor unions [ started on the right foot with DeBlasio ] ( URL_1 ) , and [ most of the unions have accepted the new contracts ] ( URL_2 ) , the Police union has not accepted their new contract , although it 's similar to the ones other labor unions have reviewed and accepted ( I ca n't find the link to this part ) .\",\n          \"!\\r\\nWhile it is true that there is a lot of free pornography available on the internet, many adult film actors and actresses are still able to make a living doing what they do. One way they can get paid is by working for a company that produces adult films and selling those films to people who want to watch them. Another way they can make money is by performing live webcam shows for people who are willing to pay to watch them.

Replace \" Best Seller \" by something like \" Oscars \" and every \" best seller \" book is basically an \" oscar - winning \" book . May not have won the \" Best film \" , but even if you won the best director or best script , you 're still an \" oscar - winning \" film . Same thing for best sellers . Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that . Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week . I guess even if you do n't stay there for long , you still achieved the status . Hence , # 1 best seller ., If you 're hearing about it , it 's because it was a very good or very well - publicized book ( or both ) , and almost every good or well - publicized book will be # 1 on the NY Times bestseller list for at least a little bit . Kindof like how almost every big or good movies are # 1 at the box office on their opening weekend ., One reason is lots of catagories . However , how the NY Times calculates its best seller list is n't comprehensive , and is pretty well understood by publishers . So publishers can [ buy a few books ] ( URL_0 ) in the right bookstores and send a book to the top of the list for at least a week .]\n",

Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good ., In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical ., Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads . And your government wants above all cheap and effective solutions that reduce winter accidents and keep people safe . They do n't care as much about the finish on your 1994 Honda Prelude .]\n",
              "2        [The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out ., HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there ., There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .]\n",

Who 's next ... Castro ? Angela Merkel ? Anyways , rumour has it that he 's ultra paranoid about exactly that and travels around in tanks and armoured trains that make Limo 1 look like a tonka toy ., It would n't really do any good . It 's not like North Korea would instantly convert to freedom - loving democracy if he died ., Partly because any country found to be doing so would incur China 's wrath , and generally look bad to the international community .

That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded ., The importance of the Wright Brothers and other early inventors was to prove it could be done . Once proven , the rest is just a process of incremental improvements that add up over time . Keep in mind that while there are lots of nifty stuff in modern aircraft , the biggest thing in my opinion that makes modern aircraft possible are the engines and the only major change from 100 years ago has been from piston to turbine . Every other engine development is just making what we had the year before , a bit better , a bit lighter , a bit more powerful , a bit more reliable .]\n",

However, a significant increase in blood pressure such as the one you described could be a cause for concern, especially if you have peripheral artery disease (PAD) and are taking lisinopril to manage your blood pressure. It's important to discuss this change in your blood pressure with your healthcare provider, as they may need to adjust your medication or recommend lifestyle changes to help manage your blood pressure.

Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good ., In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical ., Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads . And your government wants above all cheap and effective solutions that reduce winter accidents and keep people safe . They do n't care as much about the finish on your 1994 Honda Prelude .]</td>\n",

However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out ., HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there ., There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts .]</td>\n",

That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded ., The importance of the Wright Brothers and other early inventors was to prove it could be done . Once proven , the rest is just a process of incremental improvements that add up over time . Keep in mind that while there are lots of nifty stuff in modern aircraft , the biggest thing in my opinion that makes modern aircraft possible are the engines and the only major change from 100 years ago has been from piston to turbine .

Yahoo! Finance reports the P/E on the Russell 2000 to be 15 as of 8/31/11 and S&P 500 P/E to be 13 (about the same as WSJ). Good catch, though!  E-mail WSJ, perhaps they will be grateful.  \n",

What it amounts down to is that this is a personal choice. You cannot receive reliable information as to whether or not co-signing this loan is a good move due to lack of information. The person involved is going to know the person they would be co-signing for, and the people on this site will only have their own personal preferences of experiences to draw from. You know if they are reliable, if they will be able to pay off the loan without need for the banks to come after you.  This site can offer general theories, but I think it should be kept in mind that this is wholly a personal decision for the person involved, and them alone to make based on the facts that they know and we do not.  \n",

So if you credit card statement closes on the 7th pay it off on the 6th in full don't pay it when its due 2/3 weeks later. Then after three months of doing that your credit score will go up based on the fact that your debt ratio is so low.  That ratio is 30% of your credit score.  It will help quite alot.  \n",

Alternatively you can trade in the said window for whatever the market is offering. how is this different from paying the dividend? I don't know much about Sweden laws. Structuring this way may be tax beneficial. The other benefit in in company's books the shareholders capital is reduced. can I trade these redemption shares during these 2 weeks in May? What is the point of trading them if they have fixed price? Yes you can. If you need money sooner ... generally the price will be discounted by few cents to cover the interest for the balance days.  \n",

Your credit card issuer should have a process in place to handle disputes and investigate the charge.Here are some steps you can take to dispute a credit card charge:Contact your credit card issuer: Call the number on the back of your credit card or go online to your account to report the disputed charge. Be sure to have your account information and any documentation, such as receipts or proof of purchase, ready to provide to the issuer.Follow the credit card issuer's dispute process: Your credit card issuer will likely have a specific process in place for handling disputes. Follow the steps outlined by the issuer to ensure that your dispute is properly documented and investigated.Keep a record of your dispute: Make sure to keep a record of your dispute, including any communication with the credit card issuer, in case you need to refer back to it later.If the credit card issuer determines that the charge was fraudulent or unauthorized, they should reverse the charge and issue you a new card if necessary. If the issuer determines that the charge was valid, they may not reverse the charge and you may need to pay the amount in question. If you disagree with the issuer's decision, you may have the option to escalate the dispute to a higher level of review or to seek recourse through other means, such as filing a complaint with a consumer protection agency.  \n",

This type of insurance provides financial protection in the event that the stay-at-home mom dies, helping to ensure that the family's financial needs are met.Stay-at-home moms often contribute significantly to their family's financial well-being through their unpaid labor, such as caring for children, managing the household, and providing support to their spouse. If the stay-at-home mom were to die, the family may face significant financial challenges in paying for childcare, household expenses, and other costs. Term life insurance can help to provide the financial resources needed to maintain the family's standard of living in the event of the stay-at-home mom's death.There are a few different factors to consider when determining how much term life insurance a stay-at-home mom should have. These include the family's financial needs, the family's debts and liabilities, and the family's future financial goals. It is generally a good idea to work with a financial planner or insurance agent to determine the appropriate amount of coverage.  \n",

The rules for SEP contributions in an LLC (Limited Liability Company) depend on the specific terms of the SEP plan and the LLC's operating agreement.Here are some general guidelines for SEP contributions in an LLC:The LLC must have a written SEP plan in place and must follow the terms of the plan.Contributions to a SEP plan are tax-deductible for the LLC.Contributions to a SEP plan must be made in cash, not in the form of property or services.SEP contributions are generally limited to a percentage of the employee's salary or wages, up to a maximum annual contribution limit set by the IRS. For 2021, the maximum contribution limit is $58,000.Employers are not required to contribute to a SEP plan every year, but if they do choose to make contributions, they must make contributions for all eligible employees.Employees are not required to contribute to a SEP plan and do not have the option to make contributions on their own.Employees are generally not permitted to withdraw funds from a SEP plan until they reach age 59 1/2, unless they meet certain exceptions, such as disability or death.It's important to note that these are general guidelines and the specific rules for SEP contributions in an LLC may vary depending on the terms of the SEP plan and the LLC's operating agreement. It's a good idea to consult with a qualified tax professional or financial advisor to understand the specific rules and requirements for SEP contributions in your LLC.  \n",

This amount is typically determined by the cost of the items you are purchasing, plus any applicable taxes and fees.To process the payment, the retailer will use a credit card terminal or a point-of-sale system that is connected to a credit card processor. The processor will verify that your credit card has sufficient funds available to cover the purchase, and then it will transfer the funds from your credit card account to the retailer's bank account.To ensure that the retailer charges the correct amount, the terminal or point-of-sale system will typically display the amount of the purchase before you confirm the payment. You can verify that this amount is correct and make any necessary adjustments before completing the payment. Additionally, you will receive a receipt for the transaction, which will show the amount charged to your credit card. You can use this receipt to verify that the correct amount was charged to your account.  \n",

What it amounts down to is that this is a personal choice. You cannot receive reliable information as to whether or not co-signing this loan is a good move due to lack of information. The person involved is going to know the person they would be co-signing for, and the people on this site will only have their own personal preferences of experiences to draw from. You know if they are reliable, if they will be able to pay off the loan without need for the banks to come after you.

If the issuer determines that the charge was valid, they may not reverse the charge and you may need to pay the amount in question.

If the stay-at-home mom were to die, the family may face significant financial challenges in paying for childcare, household expenses, and other costs. Term life insurance can help to provide the financial resources needed to maintain the family's standard of living in the event of the stay-at-home mom's death.There are a few different factors to consider when determining how much term life insurance a stay-at-home mom should have. These include the family's financial needs, the family's debts and liabilities, and the family's future financial goals.

This helps to spread out the risk, as the performance of one asset is not likely to affect the performance of the others.Volatility: Another way to evaluate risk is to look at the volatility of an investment. Volatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset fluctuates over time. Higher volatility typically means higher risk.Historical performance: You can also look at the historical performance of an investment to get an idea of how it has performed in the past. This can give you an idea of how the investment may perform in the future, although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.Risk-return tradeoff: It's important to consider the risk-return tradeoff when evaluating investments. This refers to the relationship between the level of risk and the potential return on an investment. Higher risk investments generally have the potential for higher returns, while lower risk investments may have lower returns.Professional advice: Seeking the advice of a financial professional, such as a financial advisor or investment professional, can also be helpful in evaluating investment risk. These professionals can provide guidance and recommendations based on your individual financial situation and investment goals.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The New York Times best seller list is a weekly list that ranks the best-selling books in the United States based on sales data from a number of different retailers. The list is published in the New York Times newspaper and is widely considered to be one of the most influential best seller lists in the book industry. \\nIt\\'s important to note that the New York Times best seller list is not the only best seller list out there, and there are many other lists that rank the top-selling books in different categories or in different countries. So it\\'s possible that a book could be a best seller on one list but not on another. \\nAdditionally, the term \"best seller\" is often used more broadly to refer to any book that is selling well, regardless of whether it is on a specific best seller list or not.

One way is through the sale of burial vaults, headstones, and other burial-related items. Many cemeteries have on-site sales offices where these items can be purchased. \\nAnother way cemeteries can make money is through the maintenance and care of the cemetery grounds. This includes tasks such as mowing the grass, trimming bushes and trees, and maintaining the roads and walkways. The cemetery may charge a fee for these services, which can help to offset the cost of maintaining the grounds. \\nCemeteries may also generate revenue through the rental of space for events, such as weddings or memorial services. Some cemeteries have chapels or other buildings that can be rented out for these types of events. \\nFinally, cemeteries may also generate income through the sale of cremation urns and the scattering of ashes in designated areas of the cemetery. \\nOverall, the key for a cemetery to continue operating is to generate enough revenue to cover its expenses. This can be done through a combination of the methods described above and possibly others as well.\",\n          \"Basically there are many categories of \\\" Best Seller \\\" . Replace \\\" Best Seller \\\" by something like \\\" Oscars \\\" and every \\\" best seller \\\" book is basically an \\\" oscar - winning \\\" book . May not have won the \\\" Best film \\\" , but even if you won the best director or best script , you 're still an \\\" oscar - winning \\\" film . Same thing for best sellers . Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that . Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week . I guess even if you do n't stay there for long , you still achieved the status . Hence , # 1 best seller . If you 're hearing about it , it 's because it was a very good or very well - publicized book ( or both ) , and almost every good or well - publicized book will be # 1 on the NY Times bestseller list for at least a little bit . Kindof like how almost every big or good movies are # 1 at the box office on their opening weekend . One reason is lots of catagories . However , how the NY Times calculates its best seller list is n't comprehensive , and is pretty well understood by publishers . So publishers can [ buy a few books ] ( URL_0 ) in the right bookstores and send a book to the top of the list for at least a week .\",\n          \"> I 've always wanted to know why hackers are jamming on their keyboards In reality , this does n't happen . This is done in movies to make it look dramatic and exciting . Real computer hacking involves staring at a computer screen for hours of a time , searching a lot on Google , muttering \\\" hmmm \\\" and various expletives to oneself now and then , and stroking one 's hacker - beard while occasionally tapping on a few keys . Computers are stupid , they do n't know what they are doing , they just do it . If you tell a computer to give a cake to every person that walks through the door , it will do . Hackers are the people that get extra cake by going around the building and back through the door . GLaDOS however , will give you no cake . Hackers have a deep and complete understanding of a subject ( e.g. a machine or computer program ) . They change the behavior of the subject to something that was never intended or even thought it would be possible by the creator of the subject .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"AI/Human\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Human\",\n          \"AI\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
